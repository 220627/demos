//What the heck is a DTO??? Data Transfer Object. a DTO is meant to model some data coming in from the Front End 
//An HTTP Handler will take in a JSON object sent in by the user, containing their username and password.
//This HTTP Request data gets sent to the controller, to get turned into a Java object using GSON.
//the username and password the user sends in will be put into this DTO as variables, which we'll check in the authService
//You NEVER store a DTO in the database. It's purely for DATA TRANSFER...
