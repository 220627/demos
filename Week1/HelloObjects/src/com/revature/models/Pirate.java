//Pirate extends Person!! So what? First of all, this is a primary example of INHERITANCE in java (a pillar of OOP)
//This means that the Pirate Class inherits all of the variables and methods of the Person class.
//BUT, it can also have its own variables and methods unique to the Pirate class
//Pirate is therefore a child class of Person (subclass/superclass relationship).
public class Pirate extends Person {

	//we will mess with this class tomorrow
